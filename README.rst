What is taxi ?
==============

Taxi is a timesheeting tool that focuses on simplicity to help you write your
timesheets without wasting time. All you'll do is edit a text file and write
down what you've worked on and how long, like so::

Installation
============

The easiest way to install taxi is by using ``pip``. This will fetch the latest
stable version and install it on your system::

    sudo pip install taxi

That's it! You should now be able to run ``taxi``. Head over to the
`documentation <http://taxi-timesheets.readthedocs.org/>`_ for a complete guide
on how to use Taxi.
